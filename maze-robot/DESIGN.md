# Maze Robot Game Design Doc

## Overview
This is a simple web-based game inspired by the old turtle logo programming style. The player is presented with a maze and needs to write a simple piece of code to navigate a robot through it.

## Game Flow

### Start Simple
The first level is just a straight line maze. The player writes a tiny bit of code to move the robot forward.

### Incremental Complexity
Next levels introduce turns or slightly more complex paths. The idea is to gradually lead the player to figure out a basic wall-following algorithm, like a depth-first search by keeping a "hand" on the wall.

### Expanding Features
Later levels could introduce elements like one-way doors or movable walls to add variety.

## Programming Language

Keep the initial language super straightforward. Instead of an assembly-style language, just use simple commands like "move forward," "turn left," "turn right."

Eventually, you can add more complexity or even a virtual machine if you want, but start simple.

## Prototype Requirements

### Web Interface
- A web interface that displays the maze on the left side
- A code editor panel on the right side for the player to write their instructions

### Controls
- "play" - Execute the entire program
- "pause" - Pause execution
- "step through" - Execute one command at a time
- "reset" - Reset the robot to the starting position

These controls allow the player to see the robot move step-by-step and debug their code.

## Implementation Details

### Commands
- `forward` or `move forward` - Move one step forward
- `turn left` or `left` - Turn 90° counterclockwise
- `turn right` or `right` - Turn 90° clockwise

### Maze Representation
- Walls: Impassable barriers
- Empty spaces: Valid paths
- Start position: Where the robot begins (marked with blue)
- End position: The goal (marked with green)

### Robot Behavior
- The robot has a direction (North, East, South, West)
- The robot can only move forward in the direction it's facing
- The robot cannot move through walls
- The robot visualized as a triangle pointing in its current direction

### Level Progression
1. **Level 1: Straight Line** - Simple forward movement
2. **Level 2: Simple Turn** - Introduces turning mechanics
3. **Level 3: Multiple Turns** - More complex navigation

## Future Enhancements

### Additional Commands
- `repeat N { commands }` - Loop syntax
- `while condition { commands }` - Conditional loops
- `if condition { commands }` - Conditional execution

### Level Elements
- One-way doors
- Movable walls
- Keys and locked doors
- Timed challenges
- Multiple robots

### Advanced Features
- Solution validation and optimization scoring
- Community-created levels
- Visual programming blocks (Scratch-like)
- Multiplayer challenges
