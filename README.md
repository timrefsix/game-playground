# Game Playground

A tiny web-based playground showcasing a simple browser game rendered with HTML5 canvas. The project is set up to deploy automatically to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

## Game Controls
- `←` / `→`: Move the paddle
- Catch the falling balls to score points and avoid letting them hit the ground.

## Development
Open `index.html` in your browser or serve the folder with any static file server.

## Deployment
Pushing changes to the `main` branch triggers the GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/pages.yml` to build and deploy the site to GitHub Pages.
